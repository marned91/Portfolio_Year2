# Purpose
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my progress as a frontend developer throughout the Noroff Frontend Development program (2023–2025). It highlights graded exam and semester projects that demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, and TypeScript — along with responsive design, accessibility, API integration, testing, and best practices in documentation and version control.

# Description
This portfolio presents four of my key projects so far. These are all graded projects:

- Cross-Course Project: Originally built with HTML and CSS, with JavaScript added later to enhance functionality.
- Semester Project 1: A design-focused project aimed at creating a responsive, multi-page website using advanced CSS and HTML.
- Project Exam 1: A dynamic, JavaScript-driven blog platform integrated with an API for real-time blog management.
- Semester Project 2: A full-featured auction website built with JavaScript, Tailwind, and Vite. It uses the Noroff Auction API to support user registration, listings, bidding, profile management, as well as search and filter functionality.

### Each project is represented as a card containing:
- The project title
- A brief description
- A screenshot of the project
- Links to the GitHub repository and live demo

### Key features of the portfolio:
- Responsive Design: Ensures the portfolio is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Project Showcase: Each project is displayed with key details and interactive links.
- Professional Documentation: Includes information on how to access and use the code for each project.

# Project Technologies
- HTML: The backbone of the portfolio's structure and content.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling and building responsive layouts efficiently.
- GitHub Pages: The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone. 

### Development Tools
- Figma: Used for wireframing and designing the user interface.
- Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor.
- GitHub: Version control system used for tracking changes.
- Online Testing Tools: For validating HTML and WCAG compliance. https://validator.w3.org/ and https://wave.webaim.org/
